# LED Matrix that Displays the Phases of the Moon

The goal of this project was to create a device that would light up in a way to mimic the phase of the moon every night. I ultimately decided on using an Adafruit LED matrix that connected to a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B and had code written in Python.

To start, git clone this repository: https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix.git

Then you can run the python file. Update the code if using something other than an Adafruit Bonnet to connect the Raspberry Pi and the LED Matrix.
